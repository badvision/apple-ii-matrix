If you don't have an old Apple machine or emulator handy, try this:
- copy the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neilk/apple-ii-matrix/master/MATRIX)
- paste it into Joshua Bell's
[Applesoft BASIC in Javascript](http://www.calormen.com/applesoft/).
- press the Run button

If you do have an Apple or emulator, you need to get to the Apple's BASIC prompt, and then
type in the lines as shown. There is no text editor; simply typing in a line preceded by a number
adds it to the program buffer. Then type RUN.

## history and sightings

I first wrote this at Vancouver Mini Maker Faire, in June 2012. I saw an old Apple II running a lacklustre demo and I decided
to bust out some quarter-century old skills. The owner of the machine graciously let me use it for a half hour or so, and
with the help of some other bystanders we got this:

Next, I saw an Apple II at Panic Software in Portland, during the XOXO Festival in September 2012, and decided to 
type it in. That's where the picture above was taken. 

October 21, 2020: The @AppleIIBot account on Twitter will post recordings of an emulator running programs communicated by tweet. I managed to get a version of MATRIX into less than 280 characters, recorded here as MATWEEX

March 23, 2021: [@bruno185](https://github.com/bruno185) created a similar program in Apple II assembly, [Apple-II-another-Matrix](https://github.com/bruno185/Apple-II-another-Matrix), and was kind enough to credit this project for the inspiration
