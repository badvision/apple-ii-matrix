# apple-ii-matrix

A BASIC program that produces a Matrix-like display on Apple II computers.

To get this running on your machine, you need to get to the Apple's BASIC prompt, and then
type in the lines as shown. There is no text editor; simply typing in a line preceded by a number
adds it to the program buffer. Then type RUN.


## history and sightings

I first created at Vancouver Mini Maker Faire, in June 2012. I saw an old Apple II running a lacklustre demo and I decided
to bust out some quarter-century old skills. The owner of the machine graciously let me use it for a half hour or so, and
with the help of some other bystanders we got this:

Next, I saw an Apple II at Panic Software in Portland, during the XOXO Festival in September 2012, and decided to 
type it in. It's been photographed by a number of people since then, including Scott Beale of Laughing Squid:
